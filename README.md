# Invasion
A small alien invasion clone made in python using pygame. 
Based off Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes

TODOs: 
* Add getters/setters for each class
* Add "start game" and "quit game" buttons when running in full-screen mode
* Reorganise game.py - too many functions/"God object" 

BUGs:
* Alien fleet not dynamically readjusting when playing in fullscreen - revisit calculation
* Speed of entire game increases as you destroy more aliens.
